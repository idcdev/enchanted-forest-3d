# Texture Files

This directory should contain the texture files for the game.

## Required Texture Files

The following texture files should be placed in this directory:

- `grass.jpg` - Grass texture for ground
- `dirt.jpg` - Dirt texture for ground
- `bark.jpg` - Bark texture for trees
- `leaves.jpg` - Leaves texture for trees
- `crystal.jpg` - Crystal texture for collectibles
- `seed.jpg` - Seed texture for collectibles

## Notes

- Texture files should be in JPG, PNG, or WebP format
- Recommended size: 512x512 or 1024x1024 pixels
- Textures should be seamless for proper tiling

## Fallback System

The game includes a fallback system that will generate simple colored textures if the actual texture files are missing. This is useful for development but should be replaced with proper textures before release.
